## Descriptive Statistics
- Continuous, e.g. trip distance, trip amount
- Discrete, e.g., passenger count
*both continuous and discrete are numerical*
- Categorical, e.g., payment type

### Types of Descriptive Statistics
Measures of
- frequency --> how often something occurs
- central tendency (mean / median / mode) --> use when want to show average or most commonly indicated response
- dispersion or variation (range (=max-min) variance / standard deviation / skew) --> use to show how spread the data is
- association (covariance, (Pearson) correlation, MI, **scatterplots**)
e.g., for MVN need vector mean and covariance matrix
PCA is a method to represent the original dependent variances using some new, transformed independent variables
